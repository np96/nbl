This code collects [Electric Imp Tails](https://electricimp.com/docs/tails/env/) sensor readings to [The Things](http://thethings.io) service. 
You will need to replace YOUR_READING_KEY and YOUR_LED_KEY with appropriate thethings.io tokens. Follow [thethings.io](http://thethings.io)
guide to obtain your thing token. Once you start the device you will see sent readings in Things manager section.
